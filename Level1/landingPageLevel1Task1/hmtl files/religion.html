                    <p class="paradatafact">While it may be that the religious streams now grouped together under the
                        rubric of Hinduism are ancient, the word 'Hindu' was not applied to them until relatively
                        recently.
                        The word “Hindu” is now taken to mean a person who follows what is called the Hindu religion, or
                        Hinduism. It was not always so.

                        In Sanskrit (as in the earlier Indo-Aryan), “sindhu” means a large body of water and its usage
                        is applied to rivers and oceans. The word was turned into the proper name of the largest river
                        in the region, now called the Indus. The terms “Hind” and “al Hind” came to be applied to the
                        Indian sub-continent – the region across the river – by Persians and Arabs starting around the
                        6th century BCE. The geographic name was applied to ethnicity and culture also. It had nothing
                        to do with religion until much later.

                    <p class="paradatafact">Islam is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, with
                        about 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide. Although its roots go back further, scholars typically date
                        the creation of Islam to the 7th century, making it the youngest of the major world religions.
                        Islam started in Mecca, in modern-day Saudi Arabia, during the time of the prophet Muhammad’s
                        life. Today, the faith is spreading rapidly throughout the world.
                        The prophet Muhammad, sometimes spelled Mohammed or Mohammad, was born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia,
                        in 570 A.D. Muslims believe he was the final prophet sent by God to reveal their faith to
                        mankind.

                        According to Islamic texts and tradition, an angel named Gabriel visited Muhammad in 610 A.D.
                        while he was meditating in a cave. The angel ordered Muhammad to recite the words of Allah.

                        Muslims believe that Muhammad continued to receive revelations from Allah throughout the rest of
                        his life.

                    <p class="paradatafact">Sikhism, religion and philosophy founded in the Punjab region of the Indian
                        subcontinent in the late 15th century. Its members are known as Sikhs. The Sikhs call their
                        faith Gurmat (Punjabi: “the Way of the Guru”). According to Sikh tradition, Sikhism was
                        established by Guru Nanak (1469–1539) and subsequently led by a succession of nine other Gurus.
                        All 10 human Gurus, Sikhs believe, were inhabited by a single spirit. Upon the death of the
                        10th, Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708), the spirit of the eternal Guru transferred itself to the
                        sacred scripture of Sikhism, Guru Granth Sahib (“The Granth as the Guru”), also known as the Adi
                        Granth (“First Volume”), which thereafter was regarded as the sole Guru. In the early 21st
                        century there were nearly 25 million Sikhs worldwide, the great majority of them living in the
                        Indian state of Punjab.

                    <p class="paradatafact">Christianity is the most widely practiced religion in the world, with more
                        than 2 billion followers. The Christian faith centers on beliefs regarding the birth, life,
                        death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. While it started with a small group of adherents, many
                        historians regard the spread and adoption of Christianity throughout the world as one of the
                        most successful spiritual missions in human history.
                        Most historians believe that Jesus was a real person who was born between 2 B.C. and 7 B.C. Much
                        of what scholars know about Jesus comes from the New Testament of the Christian Bible.

                        According to the text, Jesus was born to a young Jewish virgin named Mary in the town of
                        Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem in modern-day Palestine. Christians believe the conception was a
                        supernatural event, with God impregnating Mary via the Holy Spirit

                    <p class="paradatafact">Jainism, Indian religion teaching a path to spiritual purity and
                        enlightenment through disciplined nonviolence (ahimsa, literally “non-injury”) to all living
                        creatures.

                        Along with Hinduism and Buddhism, Jainism is one of the three most ancient Indian religious
                        traditions still in existence and an integral part of South Asian religious belief and practice.
                        While often employing concepts shared with Hinduism and Buddhism, the result of a common
                        cultural and linguistic background, the Jain tradition must be regarded as an independent
                        phenomenon rather than as a Hindu sect or a Buddhist heresy, as some earlier Western scholars
                        believed.

                    <p class="paradatafact">Buddhism is a faith that was founded by Siddhartha Gautama (“the Buddha”)
                        more than 2,500 years ago in India. With about 470 million followers, scholars consider Buddhism
                        one of the major world religions. Its practice has historically been most prominent in East and
                        Southeast Asia, but its influence is growing in the West. Many Buddhist ideas and philosophies
                        overlap with those of other faiths.

                        He decided to give up his lavish lifestyle and endure poverty. When this didn’t fulfill him, he
                        promoted the idea of the “Middle Way,” which means existing between two extremes. Thus, he
                        sought a life without social indulgences but also without deprivation.

                        After six years of searching, Buddhists believe Gautama found enlightenment while meditating
                        under a Bodhi tree. He spent the rest of his life teaching others about how to achieve this
                        spiritual state.
